	<p>These terms and conditions set out the agreement between <strong style="color:#004E5C;">LINK BROADBAND LIMITED (company number  12786507) registered address  160 City road  London EC1V 2NX</strong> (us, we or our) and You the Customer, your name and contact details are on the Order Confirmation.</p>

You are not a business and are not intending to use our service wholly or mainly for business purposes. You will be responsible for paying the charges for our service.

These terms tell you who we are, how we will provide our broadband service to you, how you and we may change or end the contract, what to do if there is a problem and other important information. Use of our broadband service is subject to our Acceptable Use Policy and our Privacy Policy which you can read on the LINK BROADBAND  Website.</p>
	<p>If the fibre broadband network has not yet been installed at your property, we will make the necessary arrangements and we will contact you with further information.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">1. Contacting LINK BROADBAND </strong><br />

We may send customer service announcements to you by email or SMS text message. Please let us know if any of your contact details change.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">3. Placing an order</strong><br />
	Residential customers can order our services with a LINK BROADBAND  representative in person or by phone, by sending an email to sales@Linkbroadbands.comor by registering your interest via our website. We can only accept orders for areas where our service is available or is about to become available.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">4. Acceptance of your order</strong><br />
	Our acceptance of your order will take place when we email your Order Confirmation at which point a contract will come into existence between you and us.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">5. Your order</strong><br />
	Your Order Confirmation details the voice and broadband service you have ordered which we agree to supply to you, according to these terms and conditions.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">Note: </strong>Optional Routers purchased from Link Broadband can only be returned if they are defective.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">6. Minimum Term</strong><br />
	Your contract with us will continue for a Minimum Term which is shown on your Order Confirmation, starting from the Broadband activation date. You must keep and pay for the voice and broadband service for the whole of the agreed Minimum Term, unless you or we are allowed to end this contract earlier.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">7. Cooling off rights</strong><br />
	You have the right to cancel your order by contacting LINK BROADBAND  Customer Services within 14 days from the day after the day on which you receive your Order Confirmation confirming the services you wish to take. You must put your request in writing to <a href="mailto:sales@Linkbroadbands.com">sales@Linkbroadbands.com </a>or by writing to our postal address LINK BROADBAND  Limited, Dartford Business Park, Victoria Road, Dartford, DA1 5FS, UK. If you request activation of your service within the cancellation period and we have started to provide the broadband service, you will have to pay us the cost of the broadband services you’ve received up to the point when you notify us of cancellation, including the Activation Fee (if applicable).</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">8. Your customer number</strong><br />
	We will assign a customer number to your order and tell you what it is when we accept your order. It will help us if you can tell us the customer number whenever<br />
	you contact us.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">9. We only operate in the UK</strong><br />
	Our website and marketing material is solely for the promotion of our services in the UK.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">10. Provision of Service and LINK BROADBAND  Equipment</strong><br />
	When the network is live past your property, we will contact you to arrange for one of our approved network installers to install and configure the equipment required to use our service, at a time which suits you.</p>
	<p>The installation team will have your contact details so that they can let you know when they will arrive, or to deal with any unexpected problems or delays. You can contact our support team at any time if you have a query about your installation on 033 0174 1444.</p>
	<p>You are responsible for procuring all necessary consents and permissions required in order for us to connect and maintain the router at your home (for example, permissions required over shared land, or where you are a tenant in a property). We may only install equipment where such permissions and consents have been fully granted.</p>
	<p>It may be necessary to carry out a site survey for non-standard, excessively long or difficult installations. Additional charges may apply for these installations which fall outside our standard installation charge. We can discuss options with you.</p>
	<p>You will need to allow the installation team to access your property as arranged in order to install your router which requires a standard power socket to plug into. We aim to locate the equipment where you prefer but sometimes this is not possible. In such circumstances, we will discuss with you a suitable alternative location for our equipment. If for any reason you wish to move the location of our equipment, please contact us to discuss your requirements and we can arrange a visit. If the size of the premises is such that our high end wifi router cannot provide signal to all areas, our installers will discuss options for additional equipment that can be used to boost the reach of the signal. The cost of any additional equipment needed for such premises is not included in our standard installation services.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">11. Non-standard installations</strong><br />
	Sometimes an installation will have specific requirements because of the length of the access route or surfaces which require special techniques to dig and re-instate (please ask us for details). Non-standard installations are outside the scope of our free installation service and will require a separate on-site visit by an installation technician who will prepare a written estimate of the installation cost. We will discuss the installation cost with you before the installation can commence. If you agree to go ahead with the installation, the installation charges will be confirmed to you in writing and once the network is installed then our service can be delivered to you according to your order. The agreed installation charge will be taken as part of your first monthly payment.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">12. Risk assessment</strong><br />
	Before commencing work, the technician (who will be a LINK BROADBAND  employee or subcontractor) will carry out a risk assessment. If the technician decides that it is not possible to carry out the installation safely, or if there is no one over the age of 18 present at the property, you will be informed and given the opportunity to make alternative arrangements. In certain circumstances we may not be able to connect our services to your premises, for example, if you live outside of our build area, you are not eligible under our credit terms, or it is not possible to connect you for other reasons eg. there is a risk of injury to our technician in accessing your property.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">13. Changes to your requirements</strong><br />
	Please note that if you change your requirements, this may affect your eligibility for a standard installation. If there has been an error in assessing the criteria for your installation, which means you do not qualify for standard installation, the technician will inform us and we will discuss and agree with you how to proceed and the charges which may apply. The technician will do everything possible to achieve your installation at the arranged time, but if it is not possible to continue with the installation because of safety issues, the complexity or the materials required, the technician will inform us and will ask you to confirm<br />
	your acceptance that a further appointment will be required.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">14. Activation</strong><br />
	Once your order is confirmed and the service is installed (if applicable) we will activate your service. As soon as we have activated your service, (your ‘Activation Date’) you may be charged a one-off Activation Fee, and our monthly charges will start to apply, as shown on the Order Confirmation. This is also when the Minimum Term starts (see below).</p>
	<p><strong> </strong></p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">Our charges and your payments</strong></p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">15. How we calculate our monthly charges</strong><br />
	The amount you pay for our broadband service depends on the level of service you have ordered and is shown as a monthly amount, including VAT on your Order Confirmation, payable in advance. Payments must be made by direct debit. Your first payment will include the Activation Fee (if any) and, where applicable, charges for non-standard installations.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">16. Minimum Term</strong><br />
	You agree that you will be tied in to accept and pay for our service for a Minimum Term which is measured from the Activation Date (for new orders) or from the date of the Order Confirmation (for changes and upgrades). The Minimum Term which applies to your order is shown on your Order Confirmation. If you end the contract during the Minimum Term, you may have to pay an early termination charge.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">17. After the Minimum Term ends</strong><br />
	The amount you pay for your voice and broadband service will not change during the Minimum Term. Your service will continue after the Minimum Term, unless you choose to end the contract, but price changes may apply (please see below).</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">18. Price changes</strong><br />
	We may review our fees and charges at any time but any price changes will not apply to contracts which are still within the Minimum Term. If our prices do change, we will give you at least 30 days’ notice and you will be entitled to contact us to discuss your contract in the event that you do not agree to accept our price changes (see below).</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">19. Changes and Upgrades</strong><br />
	If you decide to change or upgrade your service, we will tell you what your new monthly charges will be and ask you to confirm acceptance. Any Minimum Term which applies to your new service will commence when we confirm your new order.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">20. VAT rates</strong><br />
	If the rate of VAT changes between your order date and the Activation Date, or during the time we are supplying services to you, we will adjust the rate of VAT that you pay and show this on your bill. We are not responsible or liable for any charges from service providers or organisations (such<br />
	as telephone or content providers) which you may incur while using the services.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">21. If you do not pay</strong><br />
	If you do not pay us for our services when you are supposed to and you still do not make payment within 7 days of us reminding you that payment is due, we may suspend supply of the services until you have paid us the outstanding amounts. We will contact you to tell you we are suspending supply of the services. We will not suspend the services where you dispute the unpaid invoice.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">22. Late payment interest</strong><br />
	If you do not make any payment to us by the due date, we may charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of 4% a year above the base lending rate of Barclays Bank from time to time. This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You must pay us interest together with any overdue amount.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">23. What to do if you think our charges are wrong</strong><br />
	If you think an invoice is wrong please contact us promptly to let us know and we will not charge you interest until we have resolved the issue. Once the dispute is resolved we will charge you interest on correctly invoiced sums from the original due date.</p>
	<p><strong> </strong></p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">Using our service</strong></p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">24. Acceptable use</strong><br />
	You agree to abide by our Acceptable Use Policy. You may only use our service for lawful purposes. You agree that we may monitor your use of our services including data volume and type of traffic (whether authorised by statute or other legislation or legal enforcement authority or otherwise) to ensure lawful use and to assist our traffic management. If you use the service improperly, negligently or in a way which interferes with other customer’s use of the service, we may exercise our right to suspend your use of our service (see clause 5 below) or end our contract (see clause 8 below). We may immediately remove any material placed on our servers by you or other users which breaches this contract or is otherwise harmful to our interests or the interests of our other customers.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">25. Liability for breach of Acceptable Use policy</strong><br />
	You agree that you are responsible for all use of our service, whether you gave your permission or not. For example, if someone has access to your home and uses the services, we would consider them to be within your control and you could be liable for unlawful use such as illegally downloading or transmitting copyright material. You should only allow access to your wi-fi and home network to people in your property and you accept responsibility for their use of our services. You are prohibited from allowing access to your wifi or home network to neighbouring properties, either residential or business.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">26. Faults</strong><br />
	The router we supply to you to connect to our service remains our property. You are responsible for maintaining all the equipment we supply to you in good order. You should also ensure that you are aware of the installation route of the network apparatus across your property and draw this to the attention of any third party doing work on your property. If you report a fault which we trace within your property boundary, we will make an appointment to carry out repairs or replace faulty equipment but if, in the reasonable opinion of the engineer, the fault was caused by damage to the equipment or the network apparatus, then a charge may be made. You are responsible for the cost of replacing a router that is damaged by you.</p>
	<p>If there is a fault on the wider network<br />
	When we become aware of a network fault outside your property boundaries we will endeavour to ensure it is diagnosed and repaired within 1 working day.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">27. We cannot guarantee fault-free performance</strong><br />
	Due to the shared use of networks and factors outside our control, such as access to 3rd party content and services, your internet access availability and speed may vary from time to time. In addition, the speed and limitations of wi-fi (your router position, wall thickness, device capability etc) may affect the actual speed that you experience.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">28. How to tell us about problems</strong><br />
	If you have any questions or complaints about our broadband service, please contact us (our contact details appear on page 1 of these terms). IP addresses. Unless you arrange with us to have a static IP address (additional charges may apply), the internet address allocated to you may be varied at any time. It will at all times belong to us. You may not sell or agree to transfer the internet address to any person. We grant to you a non-transferable licence to use the Internet address while you receive internet access from us which will end if this contract ends.</p>
	<p><strong> </strong></p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">Suspending the services</strong></p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">29. This section outlines your rights if we suspend the service because of our actions.</strong> We may have to suspend the supply of your service:</p>

If the suspension lasts for more than 3 working days, we will adjust the price so that you do not pay for services for any period of suspension beyond 3 working days. Any adjustment will appear as a credit on your next bill.</p>

	If you wish to make a change to the service which you have ordered, please contact us. We will let you know if the change is possible. If it is possible we will let you know about any changes to the price of the service, the timing of supply or anything else which would be necessary as a result of your requested change and ask you to confirm whether you wish to go ahead with the change. If we cannot make the change or the consequences of making the change are unacceptable to you, you may want to end the contract.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">36. Minor changes to the Service</strong><br />
	We may change the service to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements; and to implement minor technical adjustments and improvements, for example to address a security threat.

	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">37. More significant changes to the Service and these terms</strong><br />
	In addition, we may make changes to our prices or other aspects of our contract but if we do so we will notify you and you may then contact us to end the contract before the changes take effect.</p>

	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">38. Your rights to end the contract</strong></p>
	<p>You can always end your contract with us<br />
	Your rights when you end the contract will depend on how we are performing and when you decide to end the contract as previously outlined in these terms (eg ending the contract during the initial cancellation period or during the Minimum Term.</p>

	This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms. Neither of us will need to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or make any changes to these terms.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">50. If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force</strong><br />
	Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>

	<p><strong> </strong></p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">54. Voice services</strong></p>
	<p>LINK BROADBAND  voice services are only available with a LINK BROADBAND  service. Your phone handset will plug into our router using the same connector that you have on your existing standard telephone.</p>
	<p>When your phone service is live (either via porting your existing number or us providing you with a new number) you will be notified by our provisioning team and at this point you can plug your phone handset into the phone socket on the back of the router. Our technicians will explain how to do this. If you have any questions or concerns with the phone service, please contact LINK BROADBAND  on 033 0174 1444 immediately using your mobile and we will test the line for you. At the point when all services are up and running (phone and broadband) we will confirm that you may cancel your existing phone service provider contract.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">55. Phone fees and rates</strong><br />
	Fees and rates that apply can be viewed in our tariff guide on www.LINK BROADBAND -uk.com. The LINK BROADBAND  monthly phone service charge is inclusive of UK landline and mobile phone calls. Call tariffs for all other destinations and premium rate numbers (including numbers starting 08, 09, 0701, 0702) are available on our website.</p>
	<p>If you use our phone services excessively above that of a normal domestic phone user, we may contact you to discuss your phone usage requirements and reserve the right to restrict, suspend or end your services. Or we may charge you our standard rates as published on our website.</p>
	<p>Call features and services functionality are subject to variation and may not be available in all areas.</p>
	<p>If you use any security, personal alarms or health monitors, please check with your providers to ensure that your alarm or monitor is compatible.</p>
	<p>Your voice services are provided over our broadband network. You should keep your broadband router plugged in and switched on at all times to be able to make and receive calls. You acknowledge that in the event of a power or network outage, your phone services will not work and you will not be able to make or receive calls, including calls to emergency services. We recommend that you consider purchasing an external battery unit to power your router in such circumstances. Alternatively, please keep a mobile phone charged and to hand in order to call emergency services if needed. Similarly, any security or personal alarms, or health monitors will not work if there is a power or network outage. Please check with your alarm or monitor provider for guidance. Any other equipment you connect to your phone line may also not work in an outage. LINK BROADBAND LIMITEDwill not be liable for any failure of any system associated with security, health monitoring or alarms, or any other such systems, due to incompatibility with our network, power outage or any other matter beyond our control or not arising out of a fault of ours.</p>
	<p>If you keep your existing phone number and take a phone line from us as part of the services, you authorise us to cancel that part of your agreement with your old voice provider. Please note, whilst we are usually able to arrange for you to keep your existing phone number when transferring your line to us, we cannot guarantee this.</p>
	<p>If you do not wish to keep your existing phone number but are taking a phone line from LINK BROADBAND , we will allocate a number to your phone line. Please note, that the phone number and any rights in it belong to LINK BROADBAND  and you may not sell it or agree to transfer the number to anyone.</p>
	<p>You agree that we will provide your phone number and address to the emergency services. Unless you state otherwise, we will also provide these details and your name to other authorised public communications providers and regulated directory service providers in order for your details to be added to phone books and other similar service providers.</p>
	<p><strong> </strong></p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">56. Broadband</strong></p>
	<p>We will provide you with a LINK BROADBAND  wireless router in order to use our services. The router remains our property and must be returned to us at the end of service. On installation our technician will power up the router and test for internet connectivity.</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">57. Our standard fix time</strong><br />
	The fix time for faults on our network is the next working day unless you select our Box Support Plus (4) which provides a 4 hour fix time from receipt by us of your notification of a network outage within our standard support times (8am to 8pm Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm Saturday and Sunday).</p>
	<p><strong style="color:#004E5C;">58. Our commitment to you</strong><br />
	We aim to provide you with continued service, however we will not be liable for service problems due to events arising out of control.</p>
	<p>Occasionally LINK BROADBAND  will need to carry out maintenance or upgrade works on the network which will be done at times during the night to minimise service disruption. Where possible, we will provide advance email notification when such work will be carried and details provided on our status update page on the website.</p>
	<p>Due to the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee specific levels of performance for internet access to sites outside of our network.</p>
